# ## Lab 09: SQL via Data API
# ---
# In this recitation, you will execute SQL queries on real data by connecting to the open data portal of [Western Pennsylavnia Regional Data Center](https://www.wprdc.org/) and requesting data via API calls.

# We will be using Allegheny County Restaurant/Food Facility Inspection Violation Dataset found here https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-restaurant-food-facility-inspection-violations. This dataset contains violation data from actual routine inspections by one of health department staff's members for the last two years. It should be fun to find out inspection results for places where we eat in Pittsburgh! =)
